# Apartment Hunter Application

This project was inspired by Toronto's terrible housing market. It is designed to aggregate over 300 apartments in Toronto into an Excel sheet that can be sorted by most expensive, least expensive, most rooms, and most area. I completed this project using the Python libraries Pandas, Selenium, BeautifulSoup, and Pandas. I hope you can find use in my work like I have!

- Webdriver waits till all apartments are loaded before scraping
- All listings are put into a pandas data frame with columns "Address", "Link", "Price ($CAD)", "Rooms", "Bathrooms", "Area (ftÂ²)"
